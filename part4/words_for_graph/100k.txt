For

Monday
November
Its
Election
Day
eve
and
the
presidential
race
has
tightened
in
the
past
week
this
beach
area
should
be
opened
and
maintained
like
how
it’s
supposed
to
be
this
be
done
from
anywhere
using
any
device
with
a
browser
or
via
the
Xero
Touch
mobile
app
this
by
the
way
with
the
grace
and
strength
of
a
true
Maiden
of
the
Revolution
and
also
the
savviness
of
a
politician
who’s
coming
into
her
own
this
has
suddenly
earned
the
police
what
they
never
got
earlier
—
respect
this
information
has
been
tempered
with
a
final
check
for
current
licensing
and
good
standing
this
in
the
same
city
and
school
district
this
is
a
grave
disservice
to
the
legacy
ofthe
Arboretum
tothe
citizens
of
San
Francisco
and
to
all
who
visit
our
city
this
is
directed
at
a
country
in
Africa;
a
country
where
gays
are
treated
no
less
humanely
than
they
are
in
many
parts
of
the
world
this
is
not
very
surprising
given
that
the
poll
campaign
ran
with
no
focus
on
womens
issues
and
little
effort
was
made
by
anyone
to
politically
mobilise
women
voters
this
leads
me
to
conclude
that
Obama
will
do
anything
however
small—and
cooperate
with
anyone—that
he
believes
will
take
him
closer
to
where
he
wants
to
go
this
leaves
us
one
more
option
a
school
in
Baltimore
for
college-bound
kids
with
a
variety
of
learning
disabilities
this
makes
it
unlikely
that
Russia
will
stand
passively
by
as
Ukraine
proceeds
with
its
free-trade
pact
with
the
EU
this
must
not
be
ignored
in
solving
the
Friday
fracas
this
points
to
the
fact
that
this
was
nothing
but
a
fake
encounter
Rabbani
asserted
this
requires
sharp
and
clear
leadership
which
banishes
the
fear
to
look
reality
in
the
eye
recognize
what
needs
to
be
done
-
then
go
and
do
it
he
concluded
this
should
add
up
to
a
great
couple
of
hours
right
this
takes
time
and
money
this
unleashing
naturally
produces
some
nonsense
this
was

it

not

not

I
couldn’t
do
more
than
pick
at
the
cold
tangle
of
beef
slices
and
white
strips
of
tripe
I
could
tell
by
the
look
on
his
face
and
in
his
eyes
that
he
thoroughly
believed
what
he
was

did
a
good
job

myself

I
doubt
very
much
that
the

dealt
with
it
sufficiently

silence
those

off

don’t

advice

SHUT
UP
just
don’t
talk

really
think
that

gave
seconds

that
would

it
didn’t
hurt
that
he
was
great
at
what
he
did
it
does
not
depend
on
who
is
in
power
it´s
a
very
old
problem
that
has
not
been
solved
it
doesn’t
exist
—
it
was
done
by
hand
many
years
ago
it
doesn’t
hurt
that
behind
the
drink
the
business
is
dedicated
to
social
consciousness
meaning
their
product
has
no
preservatives
is
fair
trade
gluten-free
vegan
and
non-GMO
it
doesn’t
hurt
to
be
in
the
hub
of
regulation
and
politics
it
forces
us
try
new
things
and
go
new
places
which
is
perfect
for
me
I
think
as
the
choice
becomes
more
and
more
clear
I
am
confident
the
Conservative
party
has
strong
members
of
Parliament
who
have
delivered
to
Quebec
real
affordable
benefits
and
projects
in
their
riding
without
raising
their
taxes
I
think
here
a
lot
of
people
dont
right
now
I
think
in
Australia
you
see
more
and
more
organisations
jumping
on
the
back
of
it
but
theres
only
a
very
few
who
are
in
the
drivers
seat
I
think
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
that’s
the
best
thing
about
PST
I
think
it
is
wise
to
back
up
the
moderates
when
they
do
something
you
agree
with
I
think
its
those
kinds
of
numbers
that
justify
the
expansion
at
RTI
I
think
one
of
the
things
that
you
walk
away
with
is
saying
Sometimes
it
does
take
an
outsider
to
discover
something
like
this
I
think
thats
going
to
be
the
end
product
of
all
of
this
I
think
that’s
important
for
us
to
recapture
that
feeling
I
think
that’s
one
of
the
ways
that
we
as
Republicans
can
overcome
a
Hillary
Clinton
presidency
I
think
thats
prob­ably
what
happened
in
Brooklyn
I
think
that’s
where
you
get
the
gist
of
her
standpoint
for
the
entire
speech
I
think
that
that—you
have
to
be
really
careful
with
not
making
your
problems
their
problems
I
think
that
you
know
thats
unfortunate
I
think
the
bottom
line
is
for
artists
to
be
honest
I
think
they
bought
Connie
and
Cat
a
doll
and
a
tea
set
I
think
this
court
case
actually
causes
us
to
ask
that
question
Rodriguez
said
I
think
this
film
is
inspired
by
my
grandparents
generation
and
the
people
I
grew
up
with
in
Memphis
I
think
ultimately
we
will
because
there
is
a
lot
of
money
to
be
made
by
everybody
and
a
lot
to
lose
if
we
are
not
smart
enough
to
work
together
it
hurts
to
lose
a
job
as
many
of
us
know
it
is
an
outrage
and
the
whole
world
knows
it
and
the
whole
world
is—most
of
the
countries
of
the
world
are
speaking
out
against
it
it
is
a
welcome
development
it
is
not
letting
up
it
isnt
happening
only
in
Europe
it
isn’t
only
the
classic
nerd
knowledge—even
the
noobiest
of
non-nerds
can
become
conversant
on
a
subject
and
connect
with
others
who
share
their
passion
it
is
that
sense
of
community
and
giving
and
caring
that
is
needed
more
than
ever
as
workers
can
now
find
jobs
closer
to
home
it
is
the
delegates
to
the
Electoral
College
who
actually
elect
the
president
it
is
the
opponents
of
globalization
the
anarchists
who
display
such
attributes
it
looked
like
he
will
win
again
-
even
though
those
pesky
trends
are
certain
to
move
against
him
it
may
be
that
the
kids
mom
*isnt*
crazypants
which
is
always
good
it
means
he
can
conserve
his
energy
for
the
other
side
of
the
court
it
really
makes
me
mad
because
their
coach
Brad
Peabody
basically
said
we
didn’t
want
to
play
them
and
that
wasn’t
the
truth
but
we’ll
settle
that
when
we
play

she

more
common
according
to
a
new
report
that
ranks

towers
by

it’s
clearly
an
issue
for
those
who
are
experiencing
a
mental
health
crisis
and
they
don’t
have
the
access
to
the
type
of
care
in
the
appropriate
setting
it’s
consistent
with
the
way
they
live
their
lives
instead
of
us
coming
and
saying
you
have
to
change
the
way
you
live
in
order
to
have
a
job
its
difficult
if
youre
not
trained
in
physics
to
use
the
terminology
to
make
new
pronouncements
or
your
own
theories
it
seemed
enjoyed
wielding
it
its
good-paying
jobs
and
low
interest
rates
that
are
helping
to
make
that
dream
a
reality
its
hard
to
imagine
them
taking
it
to
the
street
and
getting
it
on
it’s
like
how
do
you
talk
about
what’s
happening
in
the
inner
city
and
not
have
music
as
a
part
of
that
discussion
its
likely
that
my
kids
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
afford
to
live
here
its
nice
for
him
to
have
a
big
night
at
the
expense
of
the
Sabres;
they
drafted
Campbell
years
ago
and
he
spent
parts
of
eight
seasons
in
a
Buffalo
sweater
it’s
not
like
they’re
performing
poorly
now
its
not
something
thats
easily
created
it’s
only
going
to
get
more
interesting
as
OPC
joins
Georgia
Power
and
its
other
energy
partners
in
an
attempt
to
build
the
next
round
of
nuclear
generation
at
Plant
Vogtle
its
probably
five
to
years
out
it’s
really
a
surprise
he
still
believes
in
him
and
that’s
because
they
connect
its
rewarding
to
help
with
that
and
keep
my
finger
on
the
pulse
of
whats
happening
in
the
state
its
strange
to
see
some
people
having
a
glass
of
red
wine
early
in
the
mornings
in
the
cafes
its
the
combination
of
these
passions
that
has
inspired
my
recent
childrens
book
it’s
the
little
things
like
making
tea
and
coffee
–
it
takes
three
goes
to
make
sure
I
have
done
it
properly
it’s
the
same
when
we
approve
a
capital
ordinance
which
authorizes
the
issuance
of
debt
to
pay
for
capital
projects
it’s
time
for
CNN’s
Anderson
Cooper
to
come
out
it’s
unlikely
that
they
ever
will
it’s
wrongheaded
to
look
at
recent
launch
of
North
Korea’s
ballistic
missile
or
even
the
Newton

truly

it
is
as

of
the
end

of
its
kind
that
had
the

of

taking
their
show
on

spent
most
of

was
business
as
usual
on

the
Jackrabbits
as
they
picked
up
their
fourth-straight
team
title
at

it
was
caught
off
guard
by
the
changing
priorities
of
a
new

that
wants
to
address

up
